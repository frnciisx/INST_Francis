This week I was applying to an internship and hit a roadblock.
I came across a question that I did not understand and I knew that google wouldn't be of good help.
I decided to go on chatGPT and asked it "whats this asking me"
It asked me "Can you show me the exact question or instructions you’re looking at? That way I can break it down 
and explain what it’s asking you to do."

This was my only use of AI this week.
