Weeek 1
This week I was applying to an internship and hit a roadblock.
I came across a question that I did not understand and I knew that google wouldn't be of good help.
I decided to go on chatGPT and asked it "whats this asking me"
It asked me "Can you show me the exact question or instructions you’re looking at? That way I can break it down 
and explain what it’s asking you to do."

For the VS Code Assignment, I used chatGPT again to se some examples of the code because I 
couldn't picture what some of them looked like.

Week 2

Similar to last week, I used AI for some quick explanation and examples for our week two exercises
This week I used AI less though so I'm glad to be getting a small hang of this Python thing.

Week 3

This week my AI use was minimal as i used it to debug the first question of week 3 exercise.
It was a really silly mistake because I didn't add the indent properly and was so confused why my code wasn't working.

Week 4
I used Copilot AI to get suggestions for one of my assignments.
The reason for my AI use was because I didn't want to go through the hurdles of searching directly on google.
I asked the AI to give me suggestions of an information need I might have.
I didn't end up using any of these but it gave me an idea of what to do.
